# Configuration

> Starting with Nuxeo Drive 4.0, invalid parameter names and values will make the program to stop.
> This is a quality check to ensure a good experience.

Nuxeo Drive has different parameters that you can set up through:

- The REST API endpoint `/drive/configuration` served by the server (since [NXP-22946](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-22946) and Drive 3.0.0).
- The command line.
- A registry key inside `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Nuxeo\Drive` (since Drive 3.1.0, Windows only).
- A `config.ini` file that can be located in different places:
  - next to the Nuxeo Drive executable
  - from the `$HOME/.nuxeo-drive` folder
  - from the current working directory

Each of these ways overrides the previous one.

## Parameters

### Names and Values

Parameter names are quite flexible. There is no differentiation between lowercase and uppercase, nor between hyphens and underscores.
For instance, you can specify `ssl-no-verify`, `ssl_no_verify`, `ssl_no-verify` or `SSL_No_verify`, it will be the same result.

Parameter values are taken as is, except for booleans. In that case, you can specify, in lowercase or uppercase:

- `true`, `1`, `on`, `yes` or `oui` to enable
- `false`, `0`, `off`, `no` or `non` to disable

### Value Types

- bool: boolean
- int: integer
- list: list of strings (one item by line)
- map: simple key/value map.
- str: string

### Available Parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Type | Version Added | Description
|---|---|---|---|---
| `behavior` | [...](#behaviors) | map | 4.4.2 | Application behavior that can be turned on/off on-demand. That parameter cannot be set via the local configuration file: only the server has rights to define it.
| `big-file` | 300 | int | 4.1.4 | File size in MiB. Files bigger than this limit are considered "big". This implies few tweaks in the synchronization engine like bypassing most of the expensive and time consuming digest computations. It is a tradeoff to handle large files as best effort.
| `ca-bundle` | None | str | 4.0.2 | File or directory with certificates of trusted Certificate Authorities. If set, `ssl-no-verify` has no effect. See the `requests` [documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification) for more details.
| `channel` | centralized | str | 4.0.2 | Update channel. Can be centralized, release, beta or alpha.
| `chunk_limit` | 20 | int | 4.1.2 | Size in MiB above which files will be uploaded in chunks (if `chunk_upload` is `True`). Has to be above 0.
| `chunk_size` | 20 | int | 4.1.2 | Size of the chunks in MiB. Has to be above 0 and lower or equal to 20.
| `chunk_upload` | True | bool | 4.1.2 | Activate the upload in chunks for files bigger than `chunk_limit`.
| `delay` | 30 | int | 2 | Define the delay before each remote check.
| `force-locale` | None | str | 2 | Force the reset to the language.
| `handshake-timeout` | 60 | int | 2 | Define the handshake timeout.
| `ignored-files` | ... | list | 2.4.1 | File names to ignore while syncing.
| `ignored-prefixes` | ... | list | 2.4.1 | File prefixes to ignore while syncing.
| `ignored-suffixes` | ... | list | 2.4.1 | File suffixes to ignore while syncing.
| `locale` | en | str | 2 | Set up the language if not already defined. This can also be set up by the user from the Settings window.
| `log-filename` | None | str | 2 | The name of the log file.
| `log-level-console` | WARNING | str | 2 | Define level for console log. Can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. TRACE level has been deprecated since 4.1.0, and will be treated as DEBUG.
| `log-level-file` | INFO | str | 2 | Define level for file log. Can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. TRACE level has been deprecated since 4.1.0, and will be treated as DEBUG.
| `max-errors` | 3 | int | 2 | Define the maximum number of retries before considering the file as in error.
| `nofscheck` | False | bool | 2.0.911 | Disable the standard check for binding, to allow installation on network filesystem.
| `proxy-server` | None | str | 2 | Define the address of the proxy server (e.g. `http://proxy.example.com:3128`). This can also be set up by the user from the Settings window.
| `ssl-no-verify` | False | bool | 4.0.1 | Define if SSL errors should be ignored. Highly unadvised to enable this option.
| `sync-and-quit` | False | bool | 4.2.0 | Launch the synchronization and then exit the application.
| `synchronization_enabled` | True | bool | 4.4.0 | Synchronization features are enabled. If set to `False`, nothing will be downloaded/uploaded/synchronized but Direct Edit and Direct Transfer will work.
| `tmp_file_limit` | 10.0 | float | 4.1.4 | File size in MiB. Files smaller than this limit will be written at once to the file rather than chunk by chunk.
| `timeout` | 30 | int | 2 | Define the socket timeout.
| `update-check-delay` | 3600 | int | 2 | Define the auto-update check delay. 0 means disabled.
| `update-site-url` | [URL](https://community.nuxeo.com/static/drive-updates) | str | 2 | Configure a custom update website. See Nuxeo Drive Update Site for more details.
| `use-analytics` | False | bool | 4.1.0 | Share anonymous usage analytics to help the developers build the best experience for you.
| `use-sentry` | True | bool | 4.1.0 | Allow sharing error reports when something unusual happen.

### Obsolete Parameters

| Parameter | Default Value | Version Removed | New Option Name | New Default Value
|---|---|---|---|---
| `beta-update-site-url` | [URL](https://community.nuxeo.com/static/drive-updates) (str) | 4.0.2 | None | None
| `beta-channel` | False (bool) | 4.0.2 | `channel` | release (str)
| `consider-ssl-errors` | True (bool) | 4.0.1 | `ssl-no-verify` | False (bool)
| `debug` | False (bool) | 4.0.0 | None | None

| `proxy-exceptions` | None (str) | 4.0.0 | None | None
| `proxy-type` | None (str) | 4.0.0 | None | None

Other changes:

- `channel` was set to "release" in 4.0.2. It then changed to "centralized" in 4.2.0.

## Behaviors

The application can be tweaked using on-demand on/off options via the `behavior` parameter.
As this is targeting server actions, this parameter cannot be set via the local configuration file but only via the server configuration one.

Available behaviors:

| Parameter | Default Value (bool) | Version Added | Description
|---|---|---|---
| `server_deletion` | true | 4.4.2 | Allow or disallow server deletions.

Here is how to tweak behaviors via the server configuration file:

```json
{
  "behavior": {
    "server-deletion": true
  }
}
```

## Command Line Arguments

When used as a command line argument you need to prefix with the long argument modifier `--`, e.g.: `--log-level-file=DEBUG`.

## Configuration File

The format of the `config.ini` file is as following:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
env = custom

[no-updates]
; Unused section
update-check-delay = 0

[custom]
ca_bundle = C:\certificates\terena-ssl.crt
debug = False
log-level-file = DEBUG
ignored_suffixes =
    .bak
    .tmp
    .XXX
```

The `env` option from the `[DEFAULT]` section defines in which section looking for options.
Here, options defined in the `[custom]` section will be taken into account.

### Interpolation

If you are using special characters in values like:

```ini
ca_bundle = %userprofile%\.certificates
```

You may end up on such error:

```python
configparser.InterpolationSyntaxError: '%' must be followed by '%' or '(', found: '%userprofile%/.certificates'
```

This is a special processing done by the configuration parser named [values interpolation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#interpolation-of-values).

In that case, just double the percent sign:

```ini
ca_bundle = %%userprofile%%\.certificates
```
