## Abstract

Some information explaining the DEP.

## Specification

Technical and non technical details.

## Security

Keep in mind that security is a critical part:

- Are you introducing another third-party module? Is it the most secure?
- Have a look at the [OWASP top ten project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) to ensure you will not introduce holes.

This is a special section useful when implementing the DEP, but it is always good to be aware soon.

## Notes

Some additional notes.
