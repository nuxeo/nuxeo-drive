  The source code of Nuxeo Drive is available under the
GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 described below.

  Though, Nuxeo Drive depends on the PyQt component that is available
under the following licenses:

  - GNU General Public License v2
  - GNU General Public License v3
  - PyQt Commercial License
  - PyQt Embedded License

  Therefore the binary packages resulting of the assembly of the
Nuxeo Drive source code and all the third-party libraries that it
depends on, among which PyQt, are available under one of the licenses
listed above. Indeed, the binary packages are subject to the licenses
of the sources from which they have been built. As the GNU General
Public Licenses and the PyQt Commercial License are stronger than the
GNU Lesser General Public License, these are the ones that apply.

  Thus any code written on the top of Nuxeo Drive must be distributed
under the terms of one of the licenses available for PyQt.
